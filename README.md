#Brain Tumor Detection using CNN and Flask
#📌 Overview
This project is a Deep Learning-based Brain Tumor Detection System deployed using Flask. It leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify MRI images as either having a tumor or not. The model is trained using a dataset of brain MRI scans and predicts whether an uploaded MRI image shows signs of a tumor.

🛠 Features
✅ Upload MRI images for tumor detection
✅ Deep Learning model (CNN) for accurate classification
✅ Flask-based web application for easy user interaction
✅ Real-time prediction with image preprocessing
✅ User-friendly interface

🖥 Technologies Used
Python (Backend development)
Flask (Web framework)
NumPy, Pandas (Data handling)
TensorFlow/Keras (Deep Learning)
OpenCV, PIL (Image Processing)
HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend)

📌 How It Works
User uploads an MRI image through the Flask web interface.
The image is preprocessed (resized and normalized).
The CNN model analyzes the image and classifies it as:
Tumor Detected
No Tumor Detected
The result is displayed on the web page.
